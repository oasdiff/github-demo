## Demo of using oasdiff in a github workflow
This repo demonstrates how to use [oasdiff](https://github.com/Tufin/oasdiff) to check every change to an OpenAPI spec for breaking changes.  
The [github workflow](https://github.com/oasdiff/github-demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/bc.yml) uses oasdiff to create a changelog which is displayed in the [GitHub Actions Summary](https://github.com/oasdiff/github-demo/actions/runs/9797247511).  

Alternatively, you may use the [oasdiff-action](https://github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff-action).
